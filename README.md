# Potato Eating Man Game

A simple JavaScript game where you control a "person" (represented by a green square) to eat "potatoes" (represented by brown squares), similar to the classic Snake game.

## How to Play

1.  **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button.
2.  **Movement**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the person's movement.
3.  **Eat Potatoes**: Guide the person to eat the brown potato squares. Each potato eaten increases your score.
4.  **Avoid Walls**: Do not let the person hit the edges of the game canvas.
5.  **Game Over**: The game ends if the person hits a wall or itself (if it grows longer).
